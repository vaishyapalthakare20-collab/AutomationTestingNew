Before We Start — The Mental Model

We are testing SauceDemo (`https://www.saucedemo.com`), a fake online shop used
for practice. A typical user journey is:

```
Login  →  See products  →  Add to cart  →  Checkout  →  Order complete
```

Our job is to make a robot do this and check it works — every time, on every
browser, automatically.

We use Playwright (a browser-automation tool by Microsoft) with JavaScript.

Think of the framework as a kitchen:

| Kitchen thing        | Framework thing        | Job                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Recipe cards         | `tests/`               | The actual scenarios we verify                   |
| Appliances (mixer…)  | `pages/` (Page Objects)| Know *how* to operate each screen                |
| Master appliance     | `BasePage`             | Shared buttons every appliance has (on/off/etc.) |
| Pantry labels        | `utils/constants.js`   | Fixed names/URLs so nobody guesses               |
| Fridge settings      | `config/`              | Which environment/URL/users to use               |
| Prep assistant       | `fixtures/`            | Sets the table before you cook, cleans up after  |
| Grocery list         | `test-data/`           | The data your recipes consume                    |
| Helper gadgets       | `utils/`               | Small reusable tools (timer, notepad…)           |

Keep this table in mind. Every step below fills in one row.

<a id="chapter-1"></a>
Step 1 — Your First Raw Test (no framework at all)

🎯 Goal: Prove we can automate *anything* before we make it pretty.

> 📦 Install first (one-time project setup):
> ```powershell
> npm init -y                              # create package.json (if you don't have one)
> npm install -D @playwright/test          # the Playwright test runner
> npx playwright install                   # download the browser engines (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit)
> ```
> - `@playwright/test` gives us `test`, `expect`, and the `page` object.
> - `npx playwright install` downloads the actual browsers Playwright drives.
> - `-D` means "dev dependency" — a tool used for building/testing, not shipped to users.

🧠 Idea first: A test is just a script that (1) opens a page, (2) does actions,
(3) checks the result. Playwright gives us a `page` object that represents the
browser tab. We write everything inline — no structure yet.

Code (this is deliberately messy):

```javascript
// tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js  — VERSION 1 (raw)
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('valid user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com');          // 1. open
  await page.fill('#user-name', 'standard_user');        // 2. type username
  await page.fill('#password', 'secret_sauce');          // 3. type password
  await page.click('#login-button');                     // 4. click login
  await expect(page.locator('.title')).toHaveText('Products'); // 5. verify
});
```

Run it:

```powershell
npx playwright test tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js
```

✅ What you learned:
- `test(...)` defines one scenario.
- `page` is the browser tab, injected by Playwright automatically.
- `expect(...)` is the assertion (the "check").

> 🧩 Two JavaScript words you'll see everywhere: `async` and `await`.
> Browser actions are slow — opening a page or clicking takes real time. JavaScript
> doesn't wait around by default; it would fire the next line immediately. We don't
> want that. So:
> - `await` means *"pause here until this action finishes, then continue."* Every
>   Playwright action (`goto`, `fill`, `click`, `expect`) needs `await` in front of it.
> - `async` is a label we put on a function to say *"this function contains `await`
>   inside it."* You can only use `await` inside an `async` function.
>
> Rule of thumb for now: if a line talks to the browser, put `await` in front of it,
> and make sure the surrounding function starts with `async`.

That's a working test! But now look closely… it has problems.

Step 2 — The Pain of Raw Tests

😖 The Pain: Imagine we now write 50 login tests, 30 cart tests, 40 checkout
tests. Suddenly:

1. The selector `#user-name` is copy-pasted into 120 files. The day the
   developer renames it, you edit 120 files. 😱
2. The URL `https://www.saucedemo.com` is hard-coded everywhere. Testing on a
   staging server? Edit everything again.
3. The password `secret_sauce` sits in plain text in every file.
4. Every checkout test repeats *login → add to cart → go to checkout* — dozens of
   duplicated lines.

🧠 The insight: Tests should read like plain English business steps, not
like low-level clicks. The "how" (selectors, waits) must live somewhere else.

That "somewhere else" is the Page Object. On to Step 3.

---

<a id="chapter-3"></a>
Step 3 — Page Object Model (POM): Move locators out of tests

🎯 Goal: Each screen gets one class that owns its locators and actions.
Tests just call meaningful methods.

🧠 Idea first: A *Page Object* is a class named after a screen (e.g.
`LoginPage`). It stores the selectors as properties and exposes actions as methods
(`login()`, `getErrorMessage()`). Tests never see a raw selector again.

---

3.1 — What is a "class"? (a simple analogy)

Before the code, the one word you must be comfortable with is class.

Think of a class as a blueprint for a TV remote. The blueprint says: *"a remote
has these buttons (properties) and can do these things (methods)."* From one blueprint
you can build many actual remotes.

- A class = the blueprint (`LoginPage`).
- An object (or *instance*) = one actual thing built from it
  (`new LoginPage(page)`).
- Properties = the data it holds (the locators: `usernameInput`, `loginButton`).
- Methods = the actions it can do (`open()`, `login()`).

So a *Page Object* is just a blueprint for one screen: it knows where the buttons
are (properties) and how to operate them (methods).

---

3.2 — The Page Object, decoded line by line

```javascript
// pages/LoginPage.js  — VERSION 1 (basic)
class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    // Locators live HERE, not in the test
    this.usernameInput = page.getByPlaceholder('Username');
    this.passwordInput = page.locator('#password');
    this.loginButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' });
  }

  async open() {
    await this.page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com');
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    await this.usernameInput.fill(username);
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
    await this.loginButton.click();
  }
}

export default LoginPage;
```

The confusing parts, one at a time — read slowly:

```javascript
class LoginPage {
```
- `class` starts a blueprint named `LoginPage`. Everything inside `{ }` describes what
  this screen has and does.

```javascript
constructor(page) {
```
- `constructor` is a special method that runs once, automatically, the moment you
  write `new LoginPage(page)`. Its job is to set the object up.
- It receives `page` (the browser tab) so the object knows which tab to work with.

```javascript
this.page = page;
this.usernameInput = page.getByPlaceholder('Username');
```
- `this` means *"this particular object."* `this.page = page` saves the tab onto
  the object so other methods can use it later.
- `this.usernameInput = ...` stores a locator as a property. Now anywhere in the
  class you can say `this.usernameInput` instead of repeating the selector.

```javascript
async open() {
  await this.page.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com');
}
```
- A method — an action the page can perform. `open()` navigates the saved tab to
  the site. (`async`/`await` are the same as Step 1: browser actions must be awaited.)

```javascript
async login(username, password) {
  await this.usernameInput.fill(username);
  ...
}
```
- Another method, this time taking parameters. It uses the stored locators to fill
  the form and click — the *"how"* now lives inside the class, not the test.

```javascript
export default LoginPage;
```
- Makes the blueprint available to other files so a test can `import LoginPage` and do
  `new LoginPage(page)`.

> 🧠 The whole file in one sentence: *`LoginPage` is a blueprint that stores this
> screen's locators (in the constructor) and exposes readable actions (`open`,
> `login`) so tests never touch raw selectors.*

---

3.3 — The test becomes readable

```javascript
// tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js  — VERSION 2 (uses POM)
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import LoginPage from '../../pages/LoginPage.js';

test('valid user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);   // 👈 build one object from the blueprint
  await loginPage.open();                   // 👈 call its methods — reads like English
  await loginPage.login('standard_user', 'secret_sauce');
  await expect(page.locator('.title')).toHaveText('Products');
});
```

- `new LoginPage(page)` builds an actual object (this is what triggers the
  `constructor`).
- From then on the test just calls `.open()` and `.login(...)` — it reads like a
  story, and knows nothing about selectors.

💡 Why this is better:
- Selector changes now happen in one place (`LoginPage.js`).
- The test reads like a story: *open → login → check*.
- New team members understand the test without knowing the HTML.

> 🔎 Note on locators: In the real `LoginPage.js` you'll see three styles mixed
> on purpose so you learn all of them:
> - Built-in (best): `page.getByPlaceholder('Username')`, `getByRole('button', …)`
> - CSS: `page.locator('#password')`
> - XPath: `page.locator("//div[@class='login_logo']")`
> Prefer built-in > CSS > XPath in real work, but you should recognize all three.

<a id="chapter-4"></a>
Step 4 — BasePage: Stop repeating yourself

😖 The Pain: Now we build `InventoryPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`… and every
one of them re-writes the same low-level helpers: *wait for element, then click*;
*wait for element, then fill*; *get trimmed text*. That's the same handful of lines
copy-pasted into every page object.

🧠 The insight: Every page needs the same basic browser skills. Put those
shared skills in a parent class called `BasePage`, and let every page extend
it. This is classic Object-Oriented inheritance.

---

4.1 — What is "inheritance"? (a simple analogy)

Inheritance is one class borrowing all the abilities of another.

Think of appliances. Every appliance can *turn on* and *turn off*. Instead of
teaching a blender, a toaster, and a microwave each how to power on separately, you
make a general "Appliance" blueprint that knows on/off, and each specific
appliance inherits those skills — then adds its own (a blender also *blends*).

In our framework:
- `BasePage` = the general "Appliance" — it knows generic browser skills (`click`,
  `fill`, `goto`, `getText`).
- `LoginPage`, `CartPage`, etc. = specific appliances — they inherit those skills
  and add their own screen-specific methods (`login()`, `addProductToCart()`).

Two keywords make this work:
- `extends` — *"this class inherits from that one."*
- `super(...)` — *"run the parent's constructor first."*

Write the shared skills once in `BasePage`; every page gets them for free.

---

4.2 — The parent class (keep it simple for now)

```javascript
// pages/BasePage.js  — VERSION 1 (just shared waits, no logging yet)
class BasePage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  async goto(path = '/') {
    await this.page.goto(path);
  }

  // Safe click: wait until visible, THEN click
  async click(locator) {
    const element = this._resolve(locator);
    await element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    await element.click();
  }

  // Safe fill: wait until visible, THEN type
  async fill(locator, text) {
    const element = this._resolve(locator);
    await element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    await element.fill(text);
  }

  async getText(locator) {
    const element = this._resolve(locator);
    await element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    return (await element.innerText()).trim();
  }
}

export default BasePage;
```

> 🧩 New syntax in this file — read this before moving on:
> - `async` / `await` — same as Step 1: these methods talk to the browser, so each
>   action is `await`ed and each method is marked `async`.
> - `goto(path = '/')` — the `= '/'` is a default parameter. It means *"if the
>   caller doesn't pass a path, use `'/'` (the home page) automatically."* So
>   `goto()` opens `/`, while `goto('/cart.html')` opens the cart. It saves us from
>   writing the common case every time.
> - `_resolve(locator)` / `_describe(locator)` — small private helpers (the leading
>   `_` is just a naming convention for "internal, don't call from outside"). They let
>   you pass either a selector string or a Playwright locator. You don't need
>   to understand their internals yet — just know they make the methods flexible.

Why each helper does the "wait, THEN act" dance: pages load bit by bit. If you
click a button that hasn't appeared yet, the test fails randomly (this is called
*flakiness*). Every `BasePage` method first does `waitFor({ state: 'visible' })`, so
the action only happens once the element is truly ready. You write this safety once
here, and every page inherits it.

> ⏳ Coming later: notice there's no logging here yet — that's intentional. We
> haven't built a logger yet. In Step 9 we'll add one line (`logger.info(...)`)
> to each of these methods, so every click and fill automatically records what it
> did. For now, focus only on the idea of shared methods via inheritance.

---

4.3 — The child class inherits everything, decoded

Now child pages become tiny — they just declare locators & business methods, and get
`goto/click/fill/getText` for free:

```javascript
// pages/LoginPage.js  — VERSION 3 (extends BasePage)
import BasePage from './BasePage.js';

class LoginPage extends BasePage {          // 👈 inherits goto/click/fill/getText…
  constructor(page) {
    super(page);                            // 👈 pass page up to the parent
    this.usernameInput = page.getByPlaceholder('Username');
    this.passwordInput = page.locator('#password');
    this.loginButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' });
  }

  async open() {
    await this.goto('/');                   // 👈 reused from BasePage
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    await this.fill(this.usernameInput, username);   // 👈 reused, with wait built in
    await this.fill(this.passwordInput, password);
    await this.click(this.loginButton);
  }
}

export default LoginPage;
```

The two new keywords, explained:

```javascript
class LoginPage extends BasePage {
```
- `extends BasePage` = *"`LoginPage` is a `BasePage` and inherits all its
  methods."* That's why `LoginPage` can call `this.goto`, `this.click`, `this.fill`
  even though they're not defined here — they come from the parent.

```javascript
constructor(page) {
  super(page);
```
- `super(page)` = *"run the parent's constructor first, passing `page` up to it."*
  This is what makes `this.page = page` (from `BasePage`'s constructor) happen for the
  child too.
- Rule: if a child class has a `constructor`, it must call `super(...)` before
  using `this`. Forgetting `super` is the #1 beginner error here.

```javascript
async open() {
  await this.goto('/');       // defined in BasePage, used here
}
async login(...) {
  await this.fill(this.usernameInput, username);   // fill = parent; usernameInput = child
}
```
- `this.goto` and `this.fill` are inherited from `BasePage`. `this.usernameInput`
  is the child's own property. The child freely mixes both.

> 🧠 The whole idea in one sentence: `LoginPage extends BasePage` so it inherits
> generic browser skills, calls `super(page)` to let the parent set itself up, then
> adds only the locators and actions unique to the login screen.

> ❓ "Wait — `goto('/')`? Where does `/` know the website is saucedemo.com?"
> Great question, and right now the honest answer is: it doesn't yet. `/` is a
> *relative* path (just "the site root"). For it to mean
> `https://www.saucedemo.com/`, Playwright needs a base URL to attach it to — and
> we haven't set that up until Step 6 (Configuration).
>
> So until Step 6, you have two options:
> - Keep passing the full URL for now: `await this.goto('https://www.saucedemo.com')`.
> - Or write `goto('/')` already, knowing it will *start working* the moment we add
>   `baseURL` in Step 6.
>
> We deliberately write the clean `goto('/')` version now and wire up the base URL
> in Step 6 — that's the exact pain (hard-coded URLs) that Step 6 exists to solve.

💡 Why this matters:
- Every page automatically gets built-in waits (fewer flaky tests) for free.
- `BasePage` is written once; all 5 page objects benefit.
- Child pages stay focused on *what's unique* about their screen.

---

<a id="chapter-5"></a>
Step 5 — Constants: Kill the magic strings

😖 The Pain: Strings like `'/inventory.html'`, the error text
`'Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out.'`, and titles like
`'Products'` are scattered around. A typo (`'Prodcuts'`) causes a confusing failure,
and you can't reuse them.

🧠 The insight: Put every fixed string in one file and import it. If a value
changes, you change it once. Your editor also auto-completes them.

Code:

```javascript
// utils/constants.js  (excerpt)
const ROUTES = {
  LOGIN: '/',
  INVENTORY: '/inventory.html',
  CART: '/cart.html',
  CHECKOUT_STEP_ONE: '/checkout-step-one.html',
};

const MESSAGES = {
  LOCKED_OUT: 'Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out.',
  INVALID_CREDENTIALS:
    'Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service',
};

const TITLES = { PRODUCTS: 'Products', YOUR_CART: 'Your Cart' };

export { ROUTES, MESSAGES, TITLES };
```

Use them in a page or test:

```javascript
import { ROUTES } from '../utils/constants.js';

async open() {
  await this.goto(ROUTES.LOGIN);   // 👈 no magic string
}
```

💡 Why: One source of truth. No typos. Easy to update. Self-documenting.

---

<a id="chapter-6"></a>
Step 6 — Configuration: Stop hard-coding URLs & users

😖 The Pain: We still hard-code `https://www.saucedemo.com`, the users, and the
password. But real teams run the same tests against dev, qa, and
staging servers — each with a different URL. We must not edit code to switch.

🧠 The insight: Move all environment-specific values into config files, and
pick the environment with an environment variable (`ENV`). The code reads config;
it never contains the values directly.

> 📦 Install for this step:
> ```powershell
> npm install -D dotenv
> ```
> `dotenv` lets us keep secrets/overrides in a local `.env` file (git-ignored) and
> load them with `import 'dotenv/config'`. That's how `process.env.BASE_URL` etc.
> become available to `env.config.js`.

---

6.1 — What is "configuration"? (a simple analogy)

Think of a TV remote with a source button (HDMI1, HDMI2, TV…). The TV itself
never changes — you just point it at a different source. Your tests are the TV.
The *environment* (dev / qa / staging) is the source. Configuration is the source
button that lets the same tests point at a different server without rewiring
anything.

In plain terms, configuration answers three questions from outside the code:
- Which website? (`baseURL` — dev vs qa vs staging)
- Which users & password? (`credentials`)
- How long to wait, headless or not? (`timeouts`, `headless`)

We never want these values *inside* a test. If they live outside, one switch changes
everything.

---

6.2 — Three places a value can come from (and who wins)

This is the most important idea in this step. A setting like `baseURL` can be
provided in three ways, and they have a priority order:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. .env / environment variable   (HIGHEST — wins over everything) │
│  2. the environment JSON file      (config/environments/<ENV>.json) │
│  3. a hard-coded default in code   (LOWEST — last-resort fallback)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Why three layers?
- Layer 3 (default) guarantees the framework always runs, even with no setup.
- Layer 2 (JSON file) holds the normal, per-environment values your team commits.
- Layer 1 (.env) lets *one person on one machine* (or CI) override a value
  temporarily without editing any file that others share.

Keep this "1 beats 2 beats 3" rule in mind — the loader code below is literally just
this rule written in JavaScript.

---

6.3 — Two kinds of config files (know the difference)

| File                              | Committed to git? | Purpose                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `config/environments/qa.json`     | ✅ Yes            | Shared, per-environment values for the team|
| `.env`                            | ❌ No (secret) | Personal/CI overrides & secrets           |
| `.env.example`                    | ✅ Yes            | A template showing which vars *can* be set |

> 🔐 Golden rule: real secrets go in `.env` (git-ignored). The `.json` files hold
> non-sensitive, shareable defaults. `.env.example` is just a checklist so teammates
> know what they *could* override.

---

6.4 — Step-by-step: build the config layer

Step 6a — one JSON file per environment. Each environment gets its own file with
the same shape. To add "staging", you copy this and change the values — no code:

```json
// config/environments/qa.json
{
  "name": "qa",
  "baseURL": "https://www.saucedemo.com",
  "credentials": {
    "password": "secret_sauce",
    "users": { "standard": "standard_user", "lockedOut": "locked_out_user" }
  }
}
```

Step 6b — a loader that picks the right file and applies the 3-layer rule:

```javascript
// config/env.config.js  (simplified)
import 'dotenv/config';   // 👈 makes .env values appear on process.env
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const ENV_NAME = process.env.ENV || 'qa';   // 👈 which environment? default to qa

function loadEnvFile() {
  // Build the path to config/environments/<ENV_NAME>.json
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'config', 'environments', `${ENV_NAME}.json`);
  // If that file exists, read + parse it; otherwise return {} (safe fallback)
  return fs.existsSync(filePath) ? JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')) : {};
}

const fileConfig = loadEnvFile();
const fileCreds = fileConfig.credentials || {};

const env = {
  name: fileConfig.name || ENV_NAME,
  // Order of precedence: .env variable  →  JSON file  →  hard-coded default
  baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || fileConfig.baseURL || 'https://www.saucedemo.com',
  password: process.env.PASSWORD || fileCreds.password || 'secret_sauce',
  users: {
    standard: fileCreds.users?.standard || 'standard_user',
    lockedOut: fileCreds.users?.lockedOut || 'locked_out_user',
  },
  timeouts: { test: 60000, expect: 10000, action: 15000, navigation: 30000 },
  headless: process.env.HEADLESS !== 'false',
};

export default env;   // 👈 one ready-to-use object the whole framework imports
```

Let's decode the confusing parts line by line — read slowly:

```javascript
const ENV_NAME = process.env.ENV || 'qa';
```
- `process.env.ENV` is the value you set *outside* the code (e.g. `$env:ENV="staging"`).
- `|| 'qa'` means *"if nobody set ENV, use `'qa'`."* So the framework runs with zero
  setup, but you can switch environments from the command line.

```javascript
const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'config', 'environments', `${ENV_NAME}.json`);
```
- `process.cwd()` = the folder you ran the command from (the project root).
- `path.join(...)` glues the pieces into a valid path on any OS (Windows uses `\`,
  Mac/Linux use `/` — `path.join` handles that for you).
- Result: if `ENV_NAME` is `staging`, this points at
  `config/environments/staging.json`.

```javascript
return fs.existsSync(filePath) ? JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')) : {};
```
- `fs.existsSync(filePath)` — *does that file exist?*
- If yes: `fs.readFileSync` reads it as text, `JSON.parse` turns that text into a
  real object.
- If no: return `{}` (an empty object) so the framework doesn't crash — the
  hard-coded defaults will fill the gaps.

```javascript
baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || fileConfig.baseURL || 'https://www.saucedemo.com',
```
- This single line is the 3-layer rule from 6.2: try the `.env` value first, then
  the JSON file, then the hard-coded default. `||` picks the first truthy one.

```javascript
standard: fileCreds.users?.standard || 'standard_user',
```
- The `?.` is optional chaining: *"if `fileCreds.users` doesn't exist, don't
  crash — just give `undefined`,"* and then `||` falls back to `'standard_user'`.

```javascript
headless: process.env.HEADLESS !== 'false',
```
- A small trick: headless is `true` unless you explicitly set `HEADLESS=false`.
  So tests run invisibly by default, but you can *watch* them by setting that one var.

> 🧠 The whole file in one sentence: *pick the environment name, load its JSON
> file safely, then build one `env` object where every value follows "`.env` → JSON →
> default".*

Step 6c — feed config into Playwright's own config. Now Playwright itself uses our
`env` object, so tests and page objects never touch raw values:

```javascript
// playwright.config.js  (excerpt)
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import env from './config/env.config.js';   // 👈 import the object we just built

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: env.timeouts.test,
  use: {
    baseURL: env.baseURL,          // 👈 now page.goto('/') knows the base URL
    headless: env.headless,
    actionTimeout: env.timeouts.action,
  },
});
```

> ✅ This is the line that answers the Step 4 question. Setting `baseURL` here

> `this.goto('/cart.html')` becomes `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html`. That's why

---

6.5 — How it all flows when you run a test

```
You run:  $env:ENV="staging"; npx playwright test
                    │
                    ▼
1. env.config.js reads process.env.ENV        → "staging"
2. loads config/environments/staging.json     → { baseURL, credentials, ... }
3. builds the `env` object (.env > JSON > default for each value)
4. playwright.config.js imports `env` and sets baseURL/timeouts/headless
5. every page object & test uses env.baseURL, env.users.standard, etc.
                    │
                    ▼
        Same tests, now pointed at the staging server. Zero code changes.
```

Switching environments needs zero code changes:

```powershell
$env:ENV="staging"; npx playwright test     # PowerShell — point at staging
# or the ready-made scripts:
npm run test:qa
npm run test:staging
```

💡 Why this is powerful:
- Same tests, any environment — controlled from outside the code.
- Secrets/URLs never live inside tests.
- The precedence chain (`.env` → JSON → default) means the framework *always*
  runs, even if a config file is missing.

> Because we set `baseURL` here, page objects can now call `this.goto('/')` and
> `this.goto(ROUTES.INVENTORY)` with relative paths. That's why Step 5's routes
> start with `/`.

> 🧠 One-sentence summary: configuration is a "source button" — an `env` object
> assembled from `.env` → JSON → defaults — that lets the *same* tests run against
> *any* environment just by setting `ENV` on the command line.

Step 7 — Fixtures: Automatic setup (Dependency Injection)

😖 The Pain: Every test still starts with boilerplate:

```javascript
const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
const inventoryPage = new InventoryPage(page);
const cartPage = new CartPage(page);
// …repeated at the top of every single test
```

And every cart/checkout test first has to log in manually before it can do
anything useful. More copy-paste.

🧠 The insight: Playwright has fixtures — a system that automatically
prepares things your test needs, hands them over, and cleans up afterward. Instead
of building objects at the top of every test, you just *ask* for them by name and they
appear ready to use.

---

7.1 — What is a fixture, really? (a simple analogy)

Imagine a restaurant. You (the test) sit down and order *"a steak."* You don't:
- go buy the meat,
- light the grill,
- cook it,
- and wash the pan afterward.

The kitchen (the fixture) does all of that. It prepares the steak, serves
it to you, and after you leave it cleans up. You just say what you want.

A fixture is that kitchen. In our framework:
- You ask for `loginPage` → the fixture creates a `new LoginPage(page)` for you.
- You ask for `loggedInPage` → the fixture logs in first, then hands you a
  ready, authenticated page.

You never see the preparation. You just receive the finished thing.

---

7.2 — You've already been using a fixture!

Look back at Step 1. Every test looked like this:

```javascript
test('valid user can log in', async ({ page }) => { ... });
//                                     ^^^^
//                                     this is a FIXTURE
```

That `page` inside `{ }` is a built-in Playwright fixture. You never wrote
`const page = new Page()` — Playwright saw you ask for `page` in the arguments,
created a fresh browser tab, gave it to your test, and closed it when the test
finished.

Fixtures are just that same idea — but now we make our own. We'll create
`loginPage`, `inventoryPage`, `loggedInPage`, etc., so tests can ask for them the same
easy way they already ask for `page`.

> 🔑 Key mental model: whatever names you put inside `async ({ ... }) => {}` are
> fixtures you're *requesting*. Playwright looks them up, prepares them, and injects
> them. This "ask by name, receive ready-made" idea is called Dependency
> Injection.

---

7.3 — Creating our own fixtures, one at a time

We use `base.extend({ ... })` to add our own fixtures on top of Playwright's
built-in ones. Let's build up the file gradually.

First, the simplest possible fixture — `loginPage`:

```javascript
// fixtures/baseFixture.js  — VERSION 1 (one fixture)
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import LoginPage from '../pages/LoginPage.js';

const test = base.extend({
  loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {   // 👈 define a fixture named "loginPage"
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page); //   1. PREPARE: build the object
    await use(loginPage);                   //   2. SERVE: hand it to the test
  },                                        //   3. (cleanup would go here, after use)
});

export { test, expect };
```

Let's decode that fixture function line by line — this is the part that confuses
everyone, so read slowly:

```javascript
loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
```
- `loginPage:` — the name. This is the exact word a test will put in its `{ }` to
  request it.
- `async (...) => {}` — a fixture is just an async function that Playwright calls
  for you.
- `{ page }` — the fixture itself can ask for other fixtures! Here it asks for the
  built-in `page` (a browser tab) so it can build a `LoginPage` around it.
- `use` — a special function Playwright passes in. Think of it as the waiter's
  hand: *"whatever I give to `use()`, that becomes the value the test receives."*

```javascript
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);   // PREPARE (setup phase)
  await use(loginPage);                     // SERVE — pause here while the test runs
  // anything after use() = CLEANUP (teardown phase)
```

The three phases of every fixture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. SETUP     code BEFORE  await use(x)   → prepare the thing │
│  2. HAND-OVER await use(x)                → the TEST runs now │
│  3. TEARDOWN  code AFTER   await use(x)   → clean up          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`await use(x)` literally means: *"give `x` to the test, and pause this fixture here
until the test is finished."* When the test ends, execution resumes right after
`use` — that's where cleanup lives (closing files, disposing resources, etc.).

> 💡 For our page objects there's nothing to clean up, so there's no code after
> `use`. But the *slot* is always there — that's what makes fixtures powerful for
> setup and teardown.

---

7.4 — The full fixture file

Now the same pattern, repeated for every page object, plus the special
`loggedInPage`:

```javascript
// fixtures/baseFixture.js  (full idea)
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import LoginPage from '../pages/LoginPage.js';
import InventoryPage from '../pages/InventoryPage.js';
import CartPage from '../pages/CartPage.js';
import env from '../config/env.config.js';

const test = base.extend({
  // Each one: build the page object, then hand it over.
  loginPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new LoginPage(page));
  },
  inventoryPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new InventoryPage(page));
  },
  cartPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new CartPage(page));
  },

  // The star of the show: a page that is ALREADY logged in.
  loggedInPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.open();                         // 1. go to the site
    await loginPage.login(env.users.standard, env.password); // 2. log in
    await page.waitForURL(/inventory/);             // 3. wait until we're inside
    await use(page);                                // 4. hand over the READY page
  },
});

export { test, expect };
```

Why `loggedInPage` is the big win: it does the *setup phase* (open + login +
wait) before `use(page)`. So by the time your test starts, you're already past the
login screen. The test contains zero login code.

---

7.5 — How a test uses them (and what happens under the hood)

Tests now import `test` from our fixture file, not from Playwright directly:

```javascript
// A login test — page objects arrive ready to use
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/baseFixture.js';  // 👈 our file

test('valid user can log in', async ({ loginPage, inventoryPage }) => {
  //                                   ^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                                   we ASK for these two fixtures by name
  await loginPage.open();
  await loginPage.login('standard_user', 'secret_sauce');
  expect(await inventoryPage.isLoaded()).toBeTruthy();
});
```

Step-by-step, what Playwright does when this test runs:

```
1. Sees the test asks for { loginPage, inventoryPage }
2. To build loginPage it needs `page` → creates a browser tab
3. Runs the loginPage fixture setup → new LoginPage(page) → use(...) → ready
4. Runs the inventoryPage fixture setup → new InventoryPage(page) → ready
5. Injects both into the test body → your test code runs
6. Test finishes → teardown runs in reverse → the browser tab closes
```

And the cart test starts already logged in — notice there's no login code at all:

```javascript
test('user can add a product', async ({ loggedInPage, inventoryPage }) => {
  // We asked for loggedInPage, so login already happened during SETUP.
  await inventoryPage.addProductToCart('Sauce Labs Backpack');
  // …assertions
});
```

> ✅ The magic isn't magic: asking for a fixture name in `{ }` tells Playwright
> *"run that fixture's setup, give me the resu
lt."* That's the whole trick.

---

💡 Why fixtures are a big deal:
- No boilerplate: ask for what you need in the arguments; it's created for you.
- Lazy: a fixture only runs if a test actually asks for it (ask for nothing,
  build nothing).
- Auto-cleanup: anything after `await use(...)` runs automatically as teardown.
- Composable: fixtures can use other fixtures (`loggedInPage` uses `page`).
- `loggedInPage` removes login code from every non-login test.

> 🧠 One-sentence summary: a fixture is a small function that prepares
> something → hands it to your test via `use()` → cleans up, and your test gets it
> just by listing its name in `async ({ here }) => {}`.

7.6 — Fixtures in super-simple points (revision card) 🎴

Keep these in your head — this is the whole chapter in plain words:

1. What is a fixture? A helper that gets things ready before your test and
   cleans up after. Like a *waiter* 🍽️ — you just order, the kitchen does the rest.

2. Why use it? So you don't repeat the same setup (like `new LoginPage(page)` or
   login steps) at the top of every single test.

3. How do you ask for one? Just write its name inside the test's `{ }`:
   ```javascript
   test('example', async ({ loginPage }) => { ... });
   //                       👆 asking for the loginPage fixture
   ```

4. The 3 parts of every fixture — remember: SETUP → USE → CLEANUP
   ```javascript
   myFixture: async ({ page }, use) => {
     // 1️⃣ SETUP   — runs BEFORE the test (prepare the thing)
     await use(thing); // 2️⃣ USE — the TEST runs here
     // 3️⃣ CLEANUP — runs AFTER the test
   }
   ```

5. What does `use()` do? It hands your prepared thing to the test, then pauses
   and waits. When the test finishes, code after `use()` runs (cleanup).

6. Why `new LoginPage(page)`? `LoginPage` is a *class* (a blueprint). `new` builds a
   real object from it, and we pass `page` so it knows which browser tab to control.

7. `page` is a fixture too! You've used it since day one — Playwright creates the
   browser tab and cleans it up for you. Custom fixtures are the same idea, made by us.

8. Fixtures can use other fixtures. `loggedInPage` asks for `page`, then logs in —
   so tests that use it start already logged in, with zero login code.

9. They're lazy. A fixture only runs if a test actually asks for it. Ask for
   nothing = build nothing.

10. One line to remember:
    > A fixture = *prepare something → give it to the test with `use()` → clean up.*

Step 8 — Data-Driven Testing: One test, many data rows

😖 The Pain: SauceDemo has several user types (standard, problem, performance,
locked-out…). Writing a near-identical test for each — copy, paste, change one word —
is wasteful and error-prone.

🧠 The insight: Separate the data from the logic. Keep the data in a JSON
file, read it, and loop to generate one test per row. Change coverage by editing
data, not code.

---

8.1 — What "data-driven" means (a restaurant analogy)

Imagine a chef who cooks one dish — say, an omelette. The *recipe* (crack, whisk,
pour, fold) never changes. What changes is the order ticket: table 1 wants cheese,
table 2 wants mushrooms, table 3 wants plain.

A bad kitchen would train a separate chef for every possible topping. A smart
kitchen keeps one recipe and just reads the ticket.

```text
   ONE recipe (the test logic)          MANY tickets (the data rows)
   ┌───────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ open → login → check page │  ◀───  │ standard_user   ✅        │
   │ (written exactly once)     │        │ problem_user    ✅        │
   └───────────────────────────┘        │ performance...  ✅        │
                                         │ locked_out_user ❌        │
                                         └──────────────────────────┘
```

- The recipe = your test steps (the logic).
- The tickets = rows of data (usernames, expected results).
- Data-driven = *write the recipe once, feed it many tickets.*

> 🧠 In one sentence: data-driven testing means the steps stay fixed and only
> the data changes, so you add test coverage by adding data rows — not by copying code.

---

8.2 — The data lives in `test-data/` (a JSON file)

We keep the "tickets" in a plain JSON file so a non-programmer could edit them:

```json
// test-data/users.json  (shape)
{
  "standard":    { "username": "standard_user",           "canLogin": true },
  "problem":     { "username": "problem_user",            "canLogin": true },
  "performance": { "username": "performance_glitch_user", "canLogin": true },
  "lockedOut":   { "username": "locked_out_user",         "canLogin": false }
}
```

Read it slowly:
- The whole thing is one object — a set of `"key": value` pairs.
- Each key (`"standard"`, `"problem"`…) is a friendly label for one user type.
- Each value is *itself* a small object with two fields:
  - `username` — what we actually type into the login form.
  - `canLogin` — a `true`/`false` flag telling the test what to *expect*.
- Notice there's zero test code here — just facts. That's the whole point: a
  teammate can add `"guest": { ... }` without knowing Playwright.

> 💡 Why JSON and not a `.js` array? JSON is language-neutral and safe — no code
> can accidentally run from it. It's the standard "data, not logic" format.

---

8.3 — A tiny reader utility (so tests don't touch the filesystem)

Tests shouldn't know *where* files live or *how* to parse them. We hide that in one
small helper:

```javascript
// utils/dataReader.js  (excerpt)
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const DATA_DIR = path.join(process.cwd(), 'test-data');

function readJSON(fileName) {
  const filePath = path.join(DATA_DIR, fileName);
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) throw new Error(`Test data file not found: ${filePath}`);
  return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8'));
}

export { readJSON };
```

Decode it line by line:
- `import fs from 'fs'` — `fs` is Node's built-in file system module (read/check files).
- `import path from 'path'` — `path` builds file paths that work on Windows and Mac/Linux
  (so you never hand-write `test-data\users.json` vs `test-data/users.json`).
- `process.cwd()` — "current working directory" = the folder you ran the tests
  from (your project root). We join it with `'test-data'` to point at the data folder.
- `fs.existsSync(filePath)` — checks the file is really there; if not, we throw a clear
  error naming the missing file (much friendlier than a cryptic crash later).
- `fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')` — reads the file's text (`'utf-8'` = normal text).
- `JSON.parse(...)` — turns that text string into a real JavaScript object we can loop over.
- `export { readJSON }` — makes this one function available to the tests.

> 🧠 In one sentence: `readJSON('users.json')` gives the test a ready-to-use object
> and hides all the messy file-reading details in one place.

---

8.4 — Read the data and loop to build tests

Now the payoff — one loop generates a separate test for every valid user:

```javascript
// tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js  (data-driven idea)
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/baseFixture.js';
import { readJSON } from '../../utils/dataReader.js';
import env from '../../config/env.config.js';

const users = readJSON('users.json');

// One test PER valid user — generated from data
for (const [key, user] of Object.entries(users)) {
  if (!user.canLogin) continue;
  test(`valid user "${key}" can log in`, async ({ loginPage, inventoryPage }) => {
    await loginPage.open();
    await loginPage.login(user.username, env.password);
    expect(await inventoryPage.isLoaded()).toBeTruthy();
  });
}
```

Decode the tricky parts:
- `const users = readJSON('users.json')` — `users` is now the whole object from the JSON file.
- `Object.entries(users)` — this is the key trick. It turns the object into an array of
  pairs, so it can be looped:

  ```text
  { "standard": {...}, "problem": {...} }
        │  Object.entries(...)  │
        ▼                       ▼
  [ ["standard", {...}], ["problem", {...}], ... ]
  ```
- `for (const [key, user] of ...)` — loops over those pairs. The `[key, user]` part is
  destructuring: `key` grabs the label (`"standard"`), `user` grabs its object
  (`{ username, canLogin }`). Each spin of the loop handles one user.

> 🧩 New to array destructuring? Here are 2 tiny examples.
> Destructuring is just a shortcut to pull items out of an array into variables —
> instead of using `array[0]`, `array[1]`, you name them directly.

> // ✅ With destructuring (same result, one line)

> console.log(first);  // "red"
> console.log(second); // "green"
> console.log(third);  // "blue"
> ```
> The position matters: the 1st variable gets item 0, the 2nd gets item 1, etc.
>
> Example 2 — destructuring a pair (exactly like our loop):

> console.log(key);           // "standard"
> console.log(user.username); // "standard_user"
> ```
> That's why `for (const [key, user] of Object.entries(users))` works: each item is a
> 2-element array `[label, object]`, and destructuring names them `key` and `user`. 🎯

> }
>
> // ✅ WITH destructuring — names right in the loop (cleaner)
> for (const [key, user] of Object.entries(users)) {
>   console.log(key, user.username);
> }
> ```
> Both loops do the exact same thing. Destructuring just skips the `entry[0]` /

- `if (!user.canLogin) continue;` — skip users we don't expect to log in (like
  `locked_out_user`). `continue` = "skip the rest of this loop turn, go to the next row."

- `test(\`valid user "${key}" can log in\`, ...)` — the biggest idea: calling `test()`
  inside a loop creates a brand-new test each time. The name includes `${key}`, so the
  report shows `valid user "standard" can log in`, `valid user "problem" can log in`, etc.
  — each with its own pass/fail.
- `user.username` and `env.password` — the data row supplies the username; the password
  comes from config (Step 6). Data + config working together.

> 🧠 In one sentence: the loop reads each data row and calls `test()` once per row,
> so four JSON entries become four real tests without four copies of code.

8.5 — The SAME data-driven test: WITHOUT fixture vs WITH fixture

Data-driven and fixtures are two separate ideas — you can loop over data with or
without fixtures. Here is the exact same set of tests written both ways so the
difference is crystal clear.

❌ WITHOUT fixture — you build the page objects yourself in every test:

```javascript
// tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js  (data-driven, NO fixture)
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';   // 👈 plain Playwright
import { LoginPage } from '../../pages/LoginPage.js';
import { InventoryPage } from '../../pages/InventoryPage.js';
import { readJSON } from '../../utils/dataReader.js';
import env from '../../config/env.config.js';

const users = readJSON('users.json');

for (const [key, user] of Object.entries(users)) {
  if (!user.canLogin) continue;
  test(`valid user "${key}" can log in`, async ({ page }) => {   // 👈 only raw "page"
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);          // 👈 build it yourself
    const inventoryPage = new InventoryPage(page);  // 👈 build it yourself
    await loginPage.open();
    await loginPage.login(user.username, env.password);
    expect(await inventoryPage.isLoaded()).toBeTruthy();
  });
}
```

✅ WITH fixture — the page objects are handed to you ready-made:

```javascript
// tests/login/positiveLogin.spec.js  (data-driven, WITH fixture)
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/baseFixture.js';   // 👈 our fixtures
import { readJSON } from '../../utils/dataReader.js';
import env from '../../config/env.config.js';

const users = readJSON('users.json');

for (const [key, user] of Object.entries(users)) {
  if (!user.canLogin) continue;
  test(`valid user "${key}" can log in`, async ({ loginPage, inventoryPage }) => {
    //                                              👆 already built for you
    await loginPage.open();
    await loginPage.login(user.username, env.password);
    expect(await inventoryPage.isLoaded()).toBeTruthy();
  });
}
```

What changed (and what did NOT):
- The loop, the data, the `test()` calls, the assertions are 100% identical — that's
  the data-driven part.
- The only difference is where the page objects come from:
  - WITHOUT fixture → `import` each page class + `new LoginPage(page)` inside every test.
  - WITH fixture → just ask for `{ loginPage, inventoryPage }` and they arrive ready.
- Notice the top `import` line: plain `@playwright/test` vs our `baseFixture.js`.

> 🧠 Takeaway: fixtures don't replace data-driven testing — they just remove the
> repetitive setup (`new SomePage(page)`) so each looped test stays short and clean.

---

💡 Why data-driven:
- Add a new user? Add a JSON row — no new test code.
- Each row shows as its own test in the report (clear pass/fail per case).
- Logic and data evolve independently.

Step 9 — Utilities: Reusable helpers (logger, data, waits)

😖 The Pain: We keep needing the same small tools: printing nice log lines,
reading data, generating fake customer names for checkout, formatting prices. If each
test invents its own, we get chaos.

🧠 The insight: Collect these framework-agnostic helpers in `utils/`. They know
nothing about SauceDemo — they're just reliable tools any project could reuse.

> 📦 Install for the logger:
> ```powershell
> npm install -D winston
> ```
> `winston` is a popular logging library. We use it to print nice timestamped log
> lines to the console and save them to files under `logs/`. (The other helpers
> like `dataGenerator`/`stringUtils` are plain JavaScript — no install needed.)

---

9.1 — What is a "logger", and why not just `console.log`?

A logger is a tool that records *what your program did, when, and how important it
was.* You've probably used `console.log('here')` before — a logger is the grown-up
version of that.

Think of it like a flight recorder (black box) on a plane. While everything is
fine, nobody looks at it. But the moment something crashes, that recording is the
only way to know what happened leading up to it. Your tests need the same thing.

Why not just sprinkle `console.log` everywhere? Because a real logger gives you things
`console.log` can't:

| Plain `console.log`                  | A proper logger (Winston)                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No timestamp                         | Every line is time-stamped                         |
| No severity                          | Tags each line INFO / WARN / ERROR                 |
| Prints to screen only (then it's gone)| Also saves to a file you can read later        |
| No filtering                         | Can hide low-priority lines via a level switch |
| Looks the same everywhere            | Colored in the terminal, plain text in the file    |

---

9.2 — The three ideas inside a logger

Winston is built from three simple concepts. Learn these words and the code becomes
obvious:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LEVEL      how important is this message?   error > warn > info    │
│  FORMAT     what should each line look like?  (timestamp + text)    │
│  TRANSPORT  WHERE does the message go?         (console AND/OR file) │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Level — a severity dial. If you set the level to `info`, you see `info`,
  `warn`, and `error`. If you set it to `error`, you see *only* errors. It lets you
  turn the noise up or down without deleting any code.
- Format — the *shape* of each line, e.g. `2026-07-29 10:00:00 [INFO] Clicked login`.
- Transport — the *destination*. A logger can send the same message to many
  places at once (your terminal and a log file).

---

9.3 — Building the logger, decoded line by line

```javascript
// utils/logger.js  (idea)
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston';

const logger = createLogger({
  level: 'info',                                    // ← LEVEL: show info and above
  format: format.combine(                           // ← FORMAT: stack recipes together
    format.timestamp({ format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' }),
    format.printf(({ level, message, timestamp }) =>
      `${timestamp} [${level.toUpperCase()}] ${message}`)
  ),
  transports: [                                     // ← TRANSPORT: where lines go
    new transports.Console(),                                  // show in terminal
    new transports.File({ filename: 'logs/test-execution.log' }), // save to file
  ],
});

export default logger;
```

Now the confusing pieces, one at a time — read slowly:

```javascript
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston';
```
- We pull three tools out of the `winston` library: `createLogger` (the factory),
  `format` (the line-shape helpers), and `transports` (the destinations).

```javascript
const logger = createLogger({ ... });
```
- `createLogger` builds one logger object from the settings we pass. We do this
  *once* and reuse it everywhere. The object has methods like `logger.info(...)`,
  `logger.warn(...)`, `logger.error(...)`.

```javascript
level: 'info',
```
- The severity dial from 9.2. `info` means *"record info, warnings, and errors; hide
  anything less important (like `debug`)."*

```javascript
format: format.combine(
  format.timestamp({ format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' }),
  format.printf(({ level, message, timestamp }) => `${timestamp} [${level.toUpperCase()}] ${message}`)
),
```
- `format.combine(...)` stacks multiple formatting steps in order.
- `format.timestamp(...)` stamps each entry with the date/time in the pattern we
  give.
- `format.printf(...)` is the final template — it takes the pieces (`timestamp`,
  `level`, `message`) and returns the exact string we want:
  `2026-07-29 10:00:00 [INFO] Clicked login`.
- `level.toUpperCase()` just makes `info` print as `INFO`.

```javascript
transports: [
  new transports.Console(),
  new transports.File({ filename: 'logs/test-execution.log' }),
],
```
- A list of destinations. Because there are two, every log line goes to both:
  the terminal (so you see it live) and a file under `logs/` (so you can read it
  after the run finished, e.g. on CI).

```javascript
export default logger;
```
- We export the single, ready-made logger so any file can
  `import logger from '.../logger.js'` and start logging immediately.

> 🧠 The whole file in one sentence: *build one logger that stamps each message
> with a time + severity and sends it to both the screen and a file.*

---

9.4 — Using the logger (and keeping the Step 4 promise)

Remember in Step 4 we deliberately left `BasePage` with no logging and
promised to add it later? This is that moment. Because every page object extends
`BasePage`, we add logging in one place and *all* pages get it for free:

```javascript
// pages/BasePage.js  — VERSION 2 (same methods, now with logging)
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';   // 👈 the new import

class BasePage {
  async goto(path = '/') {
    logger.info(`Navigating to: ${path}`);   // 👈 added
    await this.page.goto(path);
  }

  async click(locator) {
    const element = this._resolve(locator);
    await element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    await element.click();
    logger.info(`Clicked element: ${this._describe(locator)}`);   // 👈 added
  }

  async fill(locator, text) {
    const element = this._resolve(locator);
    await element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
    await element.fill(text);
    logger.info(`Filled "${text}" into: ${this._describe(locator)}`);   // 👈 added
  }
}
```

What you get for free. A single test run now produces a readable timeline —
in the terminal and saved in `logs/test-execution.log`:

```
2026-07-29 10:00:00 [INFO] Navigating to: /
2026-07-29 10:00:01 [INFO] Filled "standard_user" into: Username
2026-07-29 10:00:01 [INFO] Filled "secret_sauce" into: #password
2026-07-29 10:00:02 [INFO] Clicked element: Login button
```

When a test fails at 2 AM on CI, you open that file and read exactly what happened,
step by step — no need to re-run and hope it fails again. That is the payoff of
building `BasePage` first: logging was added once and every page inherited it.

> 💡 When to use which level: `logger.info(...)` for normal steps,
> `logger.warn(...)` for "something odd but we continued", `logger.error(...)` for
> real failures. The `level: 'info'` setting decides how much of that you actually see.

A fake-data generator (for checkout forms):

```javascript
// utils/dataGenerator.js  (idea)
export function generateCustomer() {
  const id = Date.now();
  return { firstName: `Test${id}`, lastName: 'User', postalCode: '12345' };
}
```

Exposed as the `data` fixture so tests can grab fresh data:

```javascript
test('checkout with generated data', async ({ loggedInPage, data }) => {
  const customer = data.generateCustomer();   // unique every run
  // …fill checkout form with customer.firstName etc.
});
```

Other helpers you'll find in `utils/`: `stringUtils` (slugify, parsePrice),
`dateUtils`, `waitUtils`, `assertionUtils`, `fileUtils`. Each is small, focused, and
independently testable.

💡 Why: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One good helper beats ten copy-pasted ones.

<a id="chapter-10"></a>
Step 10 — Reporting, Screenshots & Debugging

😖 The Pain: A test failed on CI last night. You weren't watching. *What
happened?* Without evidence, you must re-run and hope it fails again.

🧠 The insight: Configure Playwright to automatically capture evidence on
failure — trace, screenshot, video — and to produce rich reports. Also attach a
screenshot from a global hook so it lands in the report.

> 📦 Install for rich reports (Allure):
> ```powershell
> npm install -D allure-playwright allure-commandline allure-js-commons
> ```
> - `allure-playwright` is the reporter that feeds results to Allure during the run.
> - `allure-commandline` is the tool that turns those results into a browsable report.
> - `allure-js-commons` is the API we use to attach rich metadata (epic, feature,
>   severity, steps, parameters…) — see 10.6.
> - The HTML reporter needs no install — it's built into `@playwright/test`.

---

10.1 — Reporters vs. artifacts (two different things)

Beginners mix these up, so nail the distinction first:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REPORTER   = the SUMMARY of the run                                 │
│               "12 passed, 2 failed" — the report you open and read   │
│                                                                         │
│  ARTIFACT   = the EVIDENCE from one test                                │
│               screenshot, video, trace — the files that prove what      │
│               happened inside a single test                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Think of a car crash investigation:
- The reporter is the *final written report* — how many cars, which ones were
  damaged, the overall outcome.
- The artifacts are the *dashcam video, the photos, the black-box trace* — the raw
  evidence for one specific crash.

You want both: a summary to see the big picture, and evidence to debug each
failure. Playwright produces both from one config.

---

10.2 — The three artifacts (your evidence)

| Artifact       | What it is                                        | When it helps                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Screenshot | A picture at the moment of failure                | "What did the page look like?"         |
| Video      | A recording of the whole test                     | "What led up to the failure?"          |
| Trace      | A step-by-step timeline you can *replay* in a viewer | "Show me every action, DOM, and network call" |

The trace is the most powerful — it's like a time-travel debugger. You open it and
scrub through each step, seeing the page snapshot, the console, and network at every
moment.

> 💡 We capture all three only on failure (`retain-on-failure`) — recording every
> passing test too would be slow and waste disk space. No failures, no clutter.

---

10.3 — Configure it, decoded line by line

```javascript
// playwright.config.js  (excerpt)
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [                                               // ← SUMMARIES (10.1)
    ['list'],                                               // live console output
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'reports/html-report' }],      // clickable HTML report
    ['allure-playwright', { resultsDir: 'reports/allure-results' }], // rich report
  ],
  use: {                                                    // ← ARTIFACTS (10.2)
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',       // step-by-step timeline, only if it fails
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',    // picture at the moment of failure
    video: 'retain-on-failure',       // recording, only if it fails
  },
});
```

The confusing parts, one at a time:

```javascript
reporter: [ ['list'], ['html', {...}], ['allure-playwright', {...}] ],
```
- `reporter` is a list, so you get several summaries at once from one run:
  - `['list']` — prints a live pass/fail list in the terminal as tests run.
  - `['html', { outputFolder: 'reports/html-report' }]` — builds a clickable HTML
    report saved to that folder.
  - `['allure-playwright', { resultsDir: 'reports/allure-results' }]` — writes raw
    results that the Allure tool later turns into a rich dashboard.
- Each reporter is `['name', { options }]` — a name plus its settings.

```javascript
use: { trace: 'retain-on-failure', screenshot: 'only-on-failure', video: 'retain-on-failure' }
```
- These live under `use` (settings applied to every test).
- `'retain-on-failure'` / `'only-on-failure'` mean *"capture this, but throw it away
  if the test passes; keep it only when the test fails."* That keeps runs fast and
  the folder clean while still giving you evidence exactly when you need it.

> 🧠 In one sentence: the `reporter` list decides *what summaries you get*, and the
> `use` block decides *what evidence is captured (and only on failure)*.

---

10.4 — Auto-attach a screenshot on failure (the `afterEach` hook)

Playwright already saves a screenshot file on failure — but we also want it embedded
inside the report so it's one click away, AND saved as a real `.png` in our own
`reports/failed-screenshots/` folder so it's easy to grab. We do both with a global
`afterEach` hook in our fixture file (remember, `afterEach` runs after *every* test):

```javascript
// fixtures/baseFixture.js  (teardown hook)
test.afterEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  if (testInfo.status !== testInfo.expectedStatus) {   // i.e. the test failed
    const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });

    // 1) Save a real .png into reports/failed-screenshots/
    const dir = path.resolve('reports/failed-screenshots');
    fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
    const safeTitle = testInfo.title.replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/gi, '_').slice(0, 80);
    const stamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir, `${safeTitle}_${stamp}.png`), screenshot);

    // 2) Embed the same image inside the report
    await testInfo.attach('failure-screenshot', {
      body: screenshot,
      contentType: 'image/png',
    });waht 
  }
});
```

Decoded, line by line:

```javascript
test.afterEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
```
- `test.afterEach(...)` = *"run this after every single test."*
- `testInfo` is an object Playwright hands us describing how the test went
  (its title, status, expected status, etc.).

```javascript
if (testInfo.status !== testInfo.expectedStatus) {
```
- `status` = what actually happened (e.g. `failed`). `expectedStatus` = what *should*
  have happened (usually `passed`).
- If they don't match, the test failed — so only then do we bother capturing.

```javascript
const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });
```
- Take a picture of the entire page (not just the visible part) and hold it in a
  variable.

```javascript
await testInfo.attach('failure-screenshot', { body: screenshot, contentType: 'image/png' });
```
- `testInfo.attach(...)` glues that image into the report under the name
  `failure-screenshot`, telling the report it's a PNG image.

> 💡 Why bother, if Playwright already screenshots on failure? The config-level
> screenshot is a loose *file* on disk; this hook embeds it directly in the HTML/
> Allure report AND drops a tidy copy in `reports/failed-screenshots/`, so whoever
> reads the report sees the picture without hunting for files.

---

10.5 — Viewing the reports

```powershell
npm run report            # open the HTML report (built-in)
npm run allure:serve      # generate + open the Allure report
```

- `npm run report` opens the clickable HTML report — a pass/fail list where you
  can drill into any test and see its attached screenshot, video, and trace.
- `npm run allure:serve` builds and opens the Allure dashboard — a richer view
  with history, categories, and trends (great for showing stakeholders).

💡 Why: Failures become self-explanatory. You open the report, see the
screenshot, replay the trace, and read the log timeline (from Step 9) — no guessing,
no re-running.

> 🧠 One-sentence summary: reporters give you the *summary* of the run, artifacts
> give you the *evidence* for each failure (captured only when needed), and the
> `afterEach` hook embeds a screenshot right into the report so debugging is one click.

---

10.6 — Making the Allure report look "real" (rich metadata)

A bare Allure report just says *pass/fail*. A production-grade report also tells you
*what area broke, how bad it is, who owns it, what data was used, and the exact steps*.
We add all of that with a tiny helper so tests stay clean.

The helper — `utils/allure.js` wraps the official `allure-js-commons` API and is
fail-safe: if Allure isn't active, every call becomes a harmless no-op (your tests
never crash because of reporting).

```javascript
// utils/allure.js  (what it gives you)
export async function allureMeta(meta) { /* epic, feature, story, severity, owner,
                                            tags, description, parameters, links,
                                            issue (Jira), tms (TestRail) */ }
export async function step(name, body)  { /* a timed, pass/fail step in the tree */ }
export async function attachJSON(name, obj) { /* attach pretty JSON evidence */ }
```

Using it in a test — one clean call up top, then readable steps:

```javascript
import { allureMeta, step, Severity } from '../../utils/allure.js';

test('TC_LOGIN_VALID: valid standard user can log in @smoke', async ({ loginPage, inventoryPage }) => {
  await allureMeta({
    epic: 'Authentication',          // top of the Behaviors tree
    feature: 'Login',                // feature under the epic
    story: 'Valid user can log in',  // user story under the feature
    severity: Severity.BLOCKER,      // blocker/critical/normal/minor/trivial
    owner: 'QA Automation Team',     // who owns it
    tags: ['smoke', 'regression'],   // filters
    description: 'Verify a standard user lands on Products.', // markdown
    parameters: { username: 'standard_user', environment: 'qa' }, // data used
    issue: { name: 'AUTH-101', url: 'https://jira.example.com/browse/AUTH-101' },
    tms: { name: 'TC_LOGIN_VALID', url: 'https://testrail.example.com/cases/1001' },
  });

  await step('Log in as standard user', async () => {
    await loginPage.login('standard_user', 'secret_sauce');
  });

  await step('Verify inventory page is loaded', async () => {
    await expect(inventoryPage.pageTitle).toHaveText('Products');
  });
});
```

What each piece unlocks in the report:

| Metadata                     | Where it shows in Allure                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `epic` / `feature` / `story` | Behaviors tab — a BDD-style tree                 |
| `severity`                   | Graphs — group failures by how bad they are      |
| `owner` / `tags`             | Filters + the test page header                       |
| `parameters`                 | The exact inputs (perfect for data-driven rows)  |
| `issue` / `tms` / `links`    | One-click jump to Jira / TestRail / a bug            |
| `step(...)`                  | A readable, timed, pass/fail step tree           |
| `attachJSON(...)`            | Evidence (request/response, context) on the test page |

Two extra files make it feel like a real CI run (written by `global-setup.js`):

- `categories.json` → the Categories tab buckets failures (Product defect, Timeout,
  Element not found…).
- `executor.json` → the Executor badge (build name/number, CI link).
- `environment.properties` → the Environment widget. This captures the exact
  laptop/machine the run executed on, so a report reader knows *where* it ran:
  - App/env: Environment, Base.URL, Browser
  - Machine/laptop: Machine.Host (hostname), Machine.User, OS, Platform,
    Architecture, CPU.Model, CPU.Cores, Memory.Total.GB, Memory.Free.GB
  - Runtime: Node.Version, CI, Executed.At

  ```javascript
  // global-setup.js — machine details come from Node's built-in "os" module
  import os from 'os';
  const properties = {
    'Machine.Host': os.hostname(),         // laptop name
    'Machine.User': os.userInfo().username,// who ran it
    OS: `${os.type()} ${os.release()}`,    // e.g. Windows_NT 10.0.22631
    Architecture: os.arch(),               // x64 / arm64
    'CPU.Model': os.cpus()[0].model,       // processor
    'CPU.Cores': os.cpus().length,         // core count
    'Memory.Total.GB': (os.totalmem() / 1024 ** 3).toFixed(1),
    // ...plus Environment, Base.URL, Browser, Node.Version, Executed.At
  };
  ```

10.7 — Where every report is stored

```
reports/
├── failed-screenshots/   ← .png saved on each failure (from the afterEach hook)
├── allure-report/        ← the generated Allure HTML dashboard
├── allure-results/       ← raw Allure results (input for the report above)
├── html-report/          ← Playwright's built-in HTML report
├── json-report/          ← machine-readable results
└── junit-report/         ← JUnit XML (for CI dashboards)
```

- Failure screenshots → `reports/failed-screenshots/`
- Allure dashboard → `reports/allure-report/` (built from `reports/allure-results/`)
- Traces & videos → `test-results/` (Playwright default) and embedded in the reports.

Step 11 — Cross-Browser & Parallel Runs

😖 The Pain: "It works in Chrome" isn't good enough — users are on Firefox and
Safari too. And running hundreds of tests one-by-one is slow.

🧠 The insight: Playwright projects let one config run the whole suite on
multiple browser engines. `fullyParallel` runs tests at the same time to save time.

> 📦 No new library — just make sure the browsers are installed:
> ```powershell
> npx playwright install               # installs Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
> ```
> Firefox and WebKit ship *with* Playwright — you don't `npm install` them
> separately. `npx playwright install` (from Step 1) downloads all three engines so
> the `projects` below can run.

Code (in `playwright.config.js`):

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  fullyParallel: true,                 // run tests simultaneously
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,     // auto-retry flaky tests on CI only
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox',  use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit',   use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
  ],
});
```

Run one browser, or all:

```powershell
npm run test:chromium     # just Chrome
npm run test              # all three, in parallel
```

💡 Why: Broad coverage + speed, with no changes to your tests.

> Tags help you slice the suite: tests tagged `@smoke` or `@regression` in their
> titles can be run alone via `npm run test:smoke` / `npm run test:regression`.

Step 12 — Putting It All Together (the full flow)

Here's what happens, end to end, when you run `npm test`:

```
1. package.json  ──► runs "npx playwright test"
2. playwright.config.js loads
      └─ imports config/env.config.js
             └─ reads ENV → loads config/environments/<ENV>.json (+ .env overrides)
3. globalSetup runs once (writes environment info for the report)
4. For each spec file under tests/:
      └─ it imports { test } from fixtures/baseFixture.js   (NOT raw Playwright)
5. A test asks for e.g. { loggedInPage, inventoryPage, data }
      └─ fixtures build them on demand:
            • page objects (extend BasePage → shared waits + logging)
            • loggedInPage logs in automatically
            • data provides fresh fake data
6. The test runs its steps:
      • page objects use constants (ROUTES/MESSAGES) — no magic strings
      • BasePage logs every action via utils/logger.js
      • data-driven tests loop over test-data/*.json
7. After each test (afterEach hook):
      • if it FAILED → screenshot captured + attached; trace/video retained
8. Reporters produce: console list + HTML + JUnit + JSON + Allure
9. You open the report and see exactly what happened.
```

And the same test suite runs on chromium/firefox/webkit, in parallel, against
any environment, all controlled from outside the test code.

This is the whole point of the framework: the *test* stays a short, readable
business story, while all the complexity (waiting, logging, config, setup, evidence,
browsers) is handled by the layers underneath.

Dependency Summary — What to install & when

Install these as you reach each step (all are dev dependencies, hence `-D`):

```powershell
# Step 1 — the foundation (do this first)
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install                    # download Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

# Step 6 — configuration & secrets
npm install -D dotenv

# Step 9 — logging utility
npm install -D winston

# Step 10 — rich reporting
npm install -D allure-playwright allure-commandline allure-js-commons
```

| Library                | Introduced in | Why we need it                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `@playwright/test`     | Step 1        | Test runner: `test`, `expect`, `page`, browsers |
| `dotenv`               | Step 6        | Load `.env` overrides into `process.env`        |
| `winston`              | Step 9        | Timestamped logs to console + files             |
| `allure-playwright`    | Step 10       | Feeds results to Allure during the run          |
| `allure-commandline`   | Step 10       | Generates/opens the browsable Allure report     |

> The HTML/JSON/JUnit reporters and Firefox/WebKit browsers come bundled with
> `@playwright/test` — no separate install. Helpers like `dataGenerator`,
> `stringUtils`, `dateUtils`, and `constants` are plain JavaScript with no dependency.

How to Teach This (suggested order for class)

1. Day 1: Chapters 1–2. Write the ugly raw test. Feel the pain.
2. Day 2: Chapters 3–4. Introduce POM, then extract `BasePage` (teach OOP live).
3. Day 3: Chapters 5–6. Constants, then multi-environment config.
4. Day 4: Chapter 7. Fixtures & dependency injection (the "aha!" moment).
5. Day 5: Chapters 8–9. Data-driven tests + utilities.
6. Day 6: Chapters 10–11. Reporting/debugging + cross-browser/parallel.
7. Day 7: Chapter 12. Run the whole suite; walk the end-to-end flow diagram.

> Teaching mantra: *Show the pain → introduce the fix → run it → explain the why.*
> Never hand students the finished framework first. Let each file earn its place.

🎉 That's the framework, from an empty folder to production-ready — one honest step
at a time. Once students internalize *why* each layer exists, the real source files
in `pages/`, `fixtures/`, `config/`, and `utils/` will read like old friends.
